Assumptions:
1) 0.0 means that the data was not inputted
2) the keys/projects names are in the format of [year][month][day]\_EXP\_##
3) There will never be any null inputs 
4) I am assuming the inputs and outputs of the experiment will not change (For the sake of the site, for UX I thought it would be better to have the user select from a drop-down menu that is hard-coded) (in reality I probably wouldn't have it hard-coded but rather have the user sepecify what the inputs and outputs of the experiment are)

What I would have done differently:
1) I would have liked to rather than deleting and reprinting each of the lines when filtering, 
I should have given the lines Ids and hid and showed the lines when it was filtered or being shown.
2) Allowed for more than 2 inputs for the charts to allow you to compare the charts of different materials
3) Add an outline to the bars on the bar chart and column chart to allow for it to be clearer where the bars are.
